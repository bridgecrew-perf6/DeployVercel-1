There is an old saying: Santorini has more churches than houses and more wine than water...
Regarding the religious feasts of Santorini, locals tend to organize them with a great love for tradition and faith. Usually, for these festivities, preparations start some days before the feast day, including cooking and decoration of the church. Every village has its own patron saint which is celebrated with passion with various ceremonies and church services. In Easter or on the feast day of Holy Virgin, the ceremony is very touching where local light candles and a procession takes place around the settlements of Santorini.
