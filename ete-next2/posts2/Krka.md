About Krka National Park
First things first, what is Krka National Park? Krka National Park is located along the Krka River in Southern Croatia, famous for its lush green vegetation and imposing waterfalls.

The park covers an area of 142 square kilometres, but the area you will normally see during a day trip is only a small portion of this. Most day tours will take the ferry from Skradin and visit the Skradinski Buk area.

The most famous spot in the park, and arguably one of the most famous in all of Croatia, is Skradinski Buk Falls. These waterfalls tumble into a vast emerald pool, which you can even swim and bathe in.

There are trails and viewpoints all around the famous Krka waterfalls. You can easily spend a day wandering around the paths of the national park, admiring the beautiful views and immersing yourself in nature.

How to get to Krka National Park from Split
Krka National Park is only about a 1.5-hour drive away from Split. You can get there either by renting a car and driving yourself, with public transport or with an organised day tour.

If you take public transport you can get a bus from Split bus station to Skradin. This is the town from which you then get the ferry to Skradinski Buk and the main area of Krka National Park.

The bus ticket is around 15 EUR per person.

We did an organised tour since it wasn’t much more expensive than the public bus, and since we weren’t close to the bus station in Split we preferred to be picked up and dropped off at our hotel.

Krka National Park entrance fees
Entrance fees vary massively, ranging from 30 HRK out of season (November to March) to 200 HRK in summer. Tickets include the ferry journey from Skradin to Skadisnki Buk and access to all areas of the park.

If you do an organised tour to Krka they will sometimes include the ticket price, but this isn’t always the case. Double check before booking so you don’t have surprises on the day! 

The tour I have linked in this post already includes the entrance fee in the final price.
