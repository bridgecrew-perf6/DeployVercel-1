So, without further ado, let’s get started with 25 Lisbon facts that no over ever tells you! These are things about Lisbon (interesting, queer, fun, and gross) that you will not find in any other guide book. But I can guarantee you that they will make your trip absolutely memorable.

Lisbon is one of the oldest cities of Europe.
Yes, you heard me right. Lisbon is one of the oldest cities in Europe.

Honestly, Lisbon is ancient. Archaeological evidence suggests the city has been inhabited since prehistoric ages. Historical records take back the city’s history to 205 BC when it was first invaded by the Romans. One of the fun facts about Lisbon is that the Romans called it Olissipo then.

Lisbon is one of Europe’s oldest capitals too, second only to Athens.

Lisbon was completely destroyed in the earthquake of 1755.
Well! Almost!

The earthquake of 1755, also known as the Great Lisbon Earthquake, wrecked havoc on the city. It was followed by a series of fires and a tsunami.

Lisbon’s commercial center, Praça do Comércio, was completely destroyed. This included the Royal Ribeira Palace too and many adjoining monuments/regions.

You can still see the earthquake’s devastating effects at the Carmo Convent which stands tall without a roof. A haunting reminder of what happened on that fateful day.

Lisbon’s beautiful Pombaline Downtown was a result of the earthquake.
The beautiful Pombaline buildings that you see at the Commercial Square today were built after the earthquake. Yes, the entire Pombaline Downtown or Baixa Pombalina, a famed attraction in Lisbon, was reconstructed after being razed to the ground.

These were no ordinary buildings. They were among the earliest earthquake resistant constructions in Europe.

It is quite interesting how earthquake tests were done in those times. Small wooden models were built. Then, troops were asked to march around these models in order to simulate an earthquake. Quite ingenuous, I would say!

The famous Rossio Square has a gory history!
Lisbon’s Rossio Square has been a meeting place for people for centuries. It has hosted and housed intellectuals and the common man for ages.

Yet, there is also a dark side to Rossio which is among the lesser-known facts about Lisbon.

The Inquisition of Lisbon was installed at Palace of Estaus on the north side of Rossio Square. Consequently, Rossio became the spot for various public executions including the first auto-da-fé!
