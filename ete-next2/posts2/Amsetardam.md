Most of Amsterdam's public venues are currently open, but take additional safety precautions and adjusted opening hours into account. A COVID entry pass is mandatory to access all public indoor spaces. Face masks are mandatory in museums, restaurants, shops, airports, hotels and public transport. For updated information about the coronavirus measures at museums, cinemas, restaurants, bars and other attractions, check government.nl. Always check the website of the venue or event for the latest news before your visit. 

Extra safety measures

The authorities will monitor compliance with the 1.5 metre rule and enforce it where necessary. Expect more surveillance near museums, parks and popular tourist attractions. For example, De Wallen (Red Light District) and Vondelpark will be actively monitored. Additional crowd control includes one-way traffic, additional traffic hosts and matrix signs. Some streets may be closed to ensure safety. Always leave an area when it gets too crowded.

Travelling to Amsterdam
Please visit government.nl for the current travel protocols and regulations. Check Schiphol.nl for the latest information about flights to Amsterdam and always visit your airline’s website to confirm any additional rules that may apply. To avoid crowds in public transport, an extra shuttle is available between Schiphol Airport and Amsterdam. You can also use the taxi services at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. 

There are no restrictions on travel within the Netherlands. However, it’s important to avoid busy places, so please keep this in mind when choosing your destination. Travel by bicycle or on foot for short journeys if possible.

Hotels and accommodation

Foreign tourists are no longer obliged to reserve their holiday accommodation before they travel to the Netherlands.

The Netherlands Board of Tourism & Conventions (NBTC) has issued a coronavirus protocol for business events in the Netherlands, which offers guidelines for organisers, suppliers and delegates of any meetings and events to follow.
