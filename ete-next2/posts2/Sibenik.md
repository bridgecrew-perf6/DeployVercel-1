Medieval Sibenik is a less touristy option than many of the neighboring cities on Croatia's popular Dalmatian Coast. It, too, fronts the Adriatic Sea, and is equally charming. Known as the gateway to the Kornati Islands, it's certainly well worth a stop on its own merit

If the scenery looks familiar, and you are a fan of Game of Thrones, you'll be pleased to know that the city appeared as a film location in three episodes of Season 5.

Television series aside, the history here is compelling, and dates back to the 11th century. There's no shortage of fun things to do and interesting places to visit, including the beautifully preserved Old Town, which is great for wandering and filled with wonderful 15th- and 16th-century architecture. And thanks to its location right on the Adriatic Sea, the weather in Sibenik is wonderful year-round, with mild winters and warm summers.

Sibenik's Cathedral of St. James (Katedrala Sv Jakova), now listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is one of the Dalmatian Coast's architectural highlights. Started in the early 15th-century, this grand cathedral took more than 100 years to complete under the initial direction of Venetian architect Antonio Dalle, a responsibility later passed to sculptor Jurac Dalmatinac and then to Nikola Firentinac.

During the course of construction, a variety of styles were incorporated, including the Gothic lower level and the Renaissance upper level. One of the most noteworthy features is the exquisite frieze on the outside of the apse with its more than 70 unique faces representing ordinary townsfolk from the 15th-century.

2. See Sibenik's Old Town Hall

The splendid old two-story Sibenik Town Hall (Gradska vijecnica), just across the square from the cathedral, is well worth a visit. Famous for its beautiful large columns, arches, and balustrade, this superb example of Renaissance architecture dates from the middle of the 16th century and was built by well-known architect Michele Sanmicheli.
